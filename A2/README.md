To generate my best results you just need to run file_generation.py (with the proper paths), then train.py and eval.py. The inputs for the latter two are configured to my best model (including the directory where the model is saved). See below for some more details.

----------------

DATA PRE-PROCESSING

To pre-process the data run file_generation.py

You need to update the variables:

datap - (default: './data/aclImdb') path to all data as downloaded from the IMDB dataset set

all the other variables should be pointing to the correct path if the folder structure is the same as downloaded from:

----------------
TRAINING

To train your model you need to execute 'train.py'. In train.py, you need to update the variables:

train_pos - path to positive train data
train_neg - path to negative train data
bigram_pos - path to positive bigram features for train data
bigram_neg - path to negative bigram features for train data
bigrams_file - path to file listing the top bigrams (used to create bigram vocabulary)

All of these files are generated by file_generation.py

To use the model with/without bigrams just use the flag --bigrams [True/False]

-----------------
EVALUATION

to run eval.py, which evaluates your model on the test set, you need to pass in two variables used to train the original model -- bigrams [True/False] and --cutoff [Integer] which indicate if bigrams were used in training and at what length was each sentence cut off. You also need to pass in the checkpoint directory. For example:

python eval.py --cutoff 50 --bigrams True --checkpoint_dir './runs/test/checkpoints.'

in the file you also need to update the variables:

test_pos = path to positive test data
test_neg = path to negative test data
test_bigram_pos = path to positive review bigram features for test data
test_bigram_neg = path to neg review bigram features for test data

bigrams_file - path to file listing the top bigrams (used to create bigram vocabulary)

All of these files are generated by file_generation.py
